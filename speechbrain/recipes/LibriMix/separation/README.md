# Speech separation with LibriMix
This folder contains some popular recipes for the [LibriMix Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11262.pdf) (2/3 sources).

* This recipe supports train with several source separation models on LibriMix, including [Sepformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13154), [DPRNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06379), [ConvTasnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07454), [DPTNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13975).

## Installing Extra Dependencies

Before proceeding, ensure you have installed the necessary additional dependencies. To do this, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r ../extra_requirements.txt
```

## How to run
To run it:

```shell
python train.py hparams/sepformer-libri2mix.yaml --data_folder yourpath/Libri2Mix
python train.py hparams/sepformer-libri3mix.yaml --data_folder yourpath/Libri3Mix

```
Note that during training we print the negative SI-SNR (as we treat this value as the loss).

## How to run on test sets only
If you want to run it on the test sets only, you can add the flag `--test_only` to the following command:

```shell
python train.py hparams/sepformer-libri2mix.yaml --data_folder yourpath/Libri3Mix --test_only
python train.py hparams/sepformer-libri3mix.yaml --data_folder yourpath/Libri3Mix --test_only
```

# Libri2/3 Mix
* The Dataset can be created using the scripts at `https://github.com/JorisCos/LibriMix`.


# Dynamic Mixing:

* This recipe supports dynamic mixing where the training data is dynamically created in order to obtain new utterance combinations during training.

# Results

Here are the SI - SNRi results (in dB) on the test set of LibriMix dataset with SepFormer:

| | SepFormer. Libri2Mix |
| --- | --- |
|SpeedAugment | 20.1|
|DynamicMixing | 20.4|


| | SepFormer. Libri3Mix |
| --- | --- |
|SpeedAugment | 18.4|
|DynamicMixing | 19.0|


# Example calls for running the training scripts

* Libri2Mix with dynamic mixing `python train.py hparams/sepformer-libri2mix.yaml --data_folder yourpath/Libri2Mix/ --base_folder_dm yourpath/LibriSpeech_processed --dynamic_mixing True`

* Libri3Mix with dynamic mixing `python train.py hparams/sepformer-libri3mix.yaml --data_folder yourpath/Libri3Mix/ --base_folder_dm yourpath/LibriSpeech_processed --dynamic_mixing True`

* Libri2Mix with dynamic mixing with WHAM! noise in the mixtures `python train.py hparams/sepformer-libri2mix.yaml --data_folder yourpath/Libri2Mix/ --base_folder_dm yourpath/LibriSpeech_processed --dynamic_mixing True --use_wham_noise True`

* Libri3Mix with dynamic mixing with WHAM! noise in the mixtures `python train.py hparams/sepformer-libri3mix.yaml --data_folder yourpath/Libri3Mix/ --base_folder_dm yourpath/LibriSpeech_processed --dynamic_mixing True --use_wham_noise True`


The output folder with the trained model and the logs can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/kmyz7tts9tyg198/AACsDcRwKvelXxEB-k5q1OaIa?dl=0) for 3-speaker mixtures and [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/skkiozml92xtgdo/AAD0eJxgbCTK03kAaILytGtVa?dl=0) for 2-speakers ones.

# Multi-GPU training

You can run the following command to train the model using Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) with 2 GPUs:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 train.py hparams/sepformer-libri2mix.yaml --data_folder /yourdatapath
```
You can add the other runtime options as appropriate. For more complete information on multi-GPU usage, take a look at this [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13pBUacPiotw1IvyffvGZ-HrtBr9T6l15).
