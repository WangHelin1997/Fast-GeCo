# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Since SpeechBrain is a beta release research-oriented toolkit, it aims to support the latest major version (at x.y level, e.g. 0.5 until 0.6 is released) with security updates, but unfortunately cannot promise long-term security updates for old versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities may be reported confidentially to speechbrainproject@gmail.com
